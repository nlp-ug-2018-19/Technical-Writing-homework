\section{Introduction}
\par IrfanView is a simple yet powerful freeware graphic viewer. It supports multiple file formats including JPEG, GIF, PSD, TIFF, CR2, and many more. IrfanView is suitable both for beginners looking to replace the default graphic viewer with a better, lightweight one, as well as professionals dealing with various file formats. It offers not only a single image view, but also a thumbnail view allowing one to preview all the graphic files in a folder. It features lossless file rotation, slideshow, image effects and text overlay, cut and crop options, and more. Lastly, IrfanView supports many plugins that allow one to expand on the already offered functions.

\section{Setting image as desktop wallpaper}

        \item For a wallpaper stretched to the size of the desktop choose "Stretched" or press CTRL, SHIFT and S (this will often result in a distorted image)
        \item For a wallpaper stretched to the size of  desktop while preserving the original ration of the image choose "Stretched proportional" or press CTRL, SHIFT and X (this will never result in a distorted image)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
